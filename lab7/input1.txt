Effective training simulators rely on accurate and relevant input data. This stage involves collecting data that 
will be used to create scenarios, models, and simulations within the training environment. For a medical 
simulator, input data might include real patient cases, medical imaging, and physiological parameters. The 
quality of the input data directly impacts the realism and effectiveness of the simulator.
